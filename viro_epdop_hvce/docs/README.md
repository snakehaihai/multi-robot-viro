# VIRO EPDOP+HVCE Documentation

## 📚 Overview

This directory contains documentation for the Multi-Robot Visual-Inertial-Ranging Odometry (VIRO) system with EPDOP screening and HVCE re-weighting.

## 📖 Contents

### Algorithm Components

1. **EPDOP Screening** 🎯
   - Estimated Position Dilution of Precision (EPDOP) based measurement screening
   - Adaptive threshold selection
   - Geometric quality assessment

2. **HVCE Re-weighting** ⚖️
   - Horizontal-Vertical Covariance Ellipsoid based measurement re-weighting
   - Dynamic uncertainty adaptation
   - Robust estimation under varying conditions

3. **Multi-Robot Integration** 🤖
   - Distributed state estimation
   - Inter-robot ranging measurements
   - Collaborative localization
